The dataset used for respiratory disease prediction has 25247 rows and 6 columns.
There are 5 categorical columns and 1 numerical column.
In this dataset Nature is the target column where nature is the high or medium for the patients.
For a Binary classification here various methods are used such as Logistic Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest,SVM,KNN,Navie Bayes,Adaboost,xgboost.  
This dataset has class imbalance ,so my approch is to remove class imbalance by using under sampling method.
For feature engineering method I used RFE method and then by using PRC curve detect that which model is best fitted model for dataset.
